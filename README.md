## üí° Project Description

This project leverages motion sensors, a NeoPixel Ring, and an LCD display to create an automated smart classroom. When motion is detected, the system updates the LCD display, turns on a servo motor, and activates the NeoPixel Ring. After a timeout period with no motion, the system automatically turns off the devices, saving power.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Motion Detection**: Uses a PIR sensor to detect motion in the classroom.
- **LCD Display**: Displays messages like "Motion Detected" or "No Motion".
- **NeoPixel Ring Light**: Illuminates in response to motion detection.
- **Buzzer Alerts**: Activates on motion detection for immediate feedback.
- **Power Efficiency**: Automatically turns off all devices after a timeout.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Components and Technologies

### Hardware
- **Arduino Uno**: The microcontroller powering the project.
- **16x2 I2C LCD Display**: Displays real-time system status.
- **PIR Sensor**: Detects motion in the classroom.
- **NeoPixel Ring Light**: Provides visual feedback for motion.
- **Buzzer/Speaker**: Alerts on motion detection.
- **5V Power Source**: Powers the components.

### Software
- **Wokwi Simulation IDE**: Virtual hardware simulation.
- **PlatformIO**: Development environment for Arduino.
- **VSCode Wokwi Extension**: Simplified simulation with a private license key.
- **C++**: Programming language used for the project logic.
- **Wokwi Simulation Configuration**: Customized setup for simulating the project.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Motion Detection**:
   - The PIR sensor detects motion.
   - If motion is detected, the system activates:
     - **NeoPixel Ring** (white light illumination).
     - **LCD Display** (message: "Motion Detected").
     - **Buzzer/Speaker** (sound alert).

2. **Timeout Feature**:
   - If no motion is detected for a specific period (5 seconds in the code):
     - The system deactivates all components.
     - LCD Display shows "No Motion".
     - Servo motor resets to its initial position.
